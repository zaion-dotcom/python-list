who am I?
Currently, I'm a computer science undergraduate studying in UFSC.
My main interests are Python, Java and Golang, but I'm still learning these main languages.
You can see more in the exercise list solution, and, in a near future, I'll show some little projects in this github.
That's all, folks.
